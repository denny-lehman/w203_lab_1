# Question overview
Did Democratic voters or Republican voters experience more difficulty voting in the 2020 election?

Petrocik 2009 paper
. Leaners contribute almost one-third of the total
amount of party voting that we observe
Supposed Independents lean one way or another, and will likely vote the way they lean

## Conceptualize
We will need to define the following concepts:
Democrat voter
Republican voter
Experience Difficulty
2020 Election

### Democrat voter:
### Republican voter:
### Experience difficulty
### 2020 election
The 2020 election will be the general election held on November 3, 2020. The conditions of this election were contriversial because they were held during the coronavirus pandemic. There was record number of voter turn out as well as record number of mail in voters.

# Define what we need

Data cleaning:
V200004 COMPLETED PRE ONLY, POST ONLY, OR COMPLETED PRE AND POST INTERVIEWS
We want only people that did pre and post (I'd imagine) (value=3)
V200005 CASE VALIDATION: ELIGIBILITY CONCERNS
We should make sure we have high quality data, keep only people that the interviewer felt had no concerns (value=0)
V200006 CASE VALIDATION: ELIGIBILITY OUTCOME
We should make sure we have high quality data, keep only people who are who they say they are (value=1)
V200007 CASE VALIDATION: PRE- AND POST-ELECTION SELECTION STATUS
we want the same respondent for the pre and post election study, if we look at pre and post data (value=1)
V200008 CASE VALIDATION: VALIDATION STUDY OUTCOME
need the right person interviewed with no correction (value=1)

Who are you:
Are you a voter?
V201014e - PRE: PARTY REGISTRATION IN STATE OF REGISTRATION (ALL REGISTRATIONS)
Defines if they are registered to a party
V201019 - PRE: DOES R INTEND TO REGISTER TO VOTE
V201019 PRE: DOES R INTEND TO REGISTER TO VOTE
Is the person going to register to vote (1. Yes, intend to register ,2. No, do not intend to register)
V201100 PRE: HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT R WILL VOTE IN NOVEMBER

V201018 - PRE: PARTY OF REGISTRATION
The political party they are registered to vote as (Democrat=1, Republican=2)
V201024 PRE: IN WHAT MANNER DID R VOTE
V201032 PRE: DOES R INTEND TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT

Which party affiliation are you?


Did you have difficulty voting?

# Define experiment design
We will use a two tailed t-test with alpha = 0.05. Our Null Hypothesis will be X. Our alternative hypothesis will be Y


# Collect data source
ANES data
The study has a total of 8,280 pre-election interviews and
7,449 post-election re-interviews.
\footnote_{American National Election Studies. 2021. ANES 2020 Time Series
Study Full Release [dataset and documentation]. July 19, 2021
version. www.electionstudies.org}
# Clean data
There was some data removed (see removed data on page 2 of the user guide)
There were weights collected (do we care about these?)

From the code book about the questionnaire,
"The Codebook includes the following information, where applicable, for each
variable: the variable name (all variable names start with a “V”, and summary
variables end with the suffix “x”), variable label (with “PRE:” indicating that it is from
the pre-election study), question wording/variable meaning, response/code values
and meanings, universe (where only a subset of respondents appear in a variable,
which respondents those should be; note that universes are not included for most
summary variables), associated survey question(s), information about whether
randomization was used, interviewer instructions, and any other notes about the
variable."


# Analyze and scale

# Test

# Interpret results

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
